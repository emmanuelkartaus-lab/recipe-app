    <h1>How to Dry Chili Peppers</h1>
    <div>
            <p class="back-link"><strong>FIRST</strong>, wash and dry your preferred chili peppers. I used Squash Red peppers that I grew
                this year, as they have a nice medium level of heat, but this will work with ANY mild or hot peppers.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p><strong></strong> slice each pepper in half lengthwise for smaller peppers, or into rings for thicker
                walled peppers. It is best to cut them into 1/4" or smaller pieces for ease and uniformity of drying.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p><strong>NEXT</strong> Set them into your dehydrator tray and dehydrate at 130 degrees F for 12 hours, or
                overnight. You may need to dehydrate longer, depending on the air conditions.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p><strong>NEXT</strong> If oven drying, you need to keep the heat at the lowest setting possible. Most
                ovens won't go as low as 130 degrees</p>

        <il class="title">

            <p>Warm up the oil. Place a skillet (with a wide rim) on the stove. Pour in 1/2 inch of oil. Heat it over
                medium heat until it reaches 350F.</p>
        </il>
        <il class="title">
            <p>Using tongs, drop in the tortilla. Tap it a few times to encourage it to puff up. And hold it there for
                about 12-15 seconds.</p>
        </il>
        <il class="title">
            <p>Flip the tortilla and then fold it in half. You want to hold it in this position so it holds its shape
                for about 12-15 seconds. The tortilla should be puffed, crispy, and golden all over and able to hold its
                shape.</p>
        </il>
        <il class="title">
            <p>Transfer it to a bed of paper towels to drain. Sprinkle them with a pinch of kosher salt. Sprinkle the
                shells with a pinch of kosher salt. Repeat with the remaining tortillas.</p>
        </il>
        <il class="title">
            <p>When the olive oil is warm, add in the ground beef, along with your store-bought or homemade taco
                seasoning and salt. Break up the ground beef into crumbles and until the spices are mixed evenly
                throughout.</p>
        </il>
        <il class="title">
            <p>Fill the shells (whether using homemade or store-bought) with the ground beef mixture.</p>
        </il>
        <il class="title">
            <p>Add the shredded cheese.</p>
        </il>
        <il class="title">
            <p>And then the lettuce, pico de gallo, sour cream, and guacamole. Serve lime wedges.</p>

        <h1>How to Make Mango Sticky Rice</h1>
        <ol>
            <il>
                <p>Rinse the glutinous rice under clean water. Add enough water to cover the rice, then stir with alum
                    for about 10 seconds and rinse. Repeat this process three times until the water runs clear. Soak the
                    rice in water for at least 3 hours.</p>

            <il>
                <p>To make the coconut sauce for the sticky rice, combine fresh coconut milk, sugar and salt in a
                    saucepan over low heat. Stir until the sugar dissolves. Add the pandan leaf. Once the mixture is
                    warm (not boiling), remove it from the heat and let it cool.</p>
            </il>
            <il>
                <p>Fill a steamer pot with water up to three-quarters full and bring to a boil. Place the soaked rice in
                    a cheesecloth or muslin-lined steamer basket and steam for about 60 minutes, or until fully cooked.
                </p>
            </il>
            <il>
                <p>While the rice is still hot, transfer it to a mixing bowl and pour over the coconut syrup. Mix well,
                    then cover and let sit for 10 minutes. Stir again to evenly distribute the syrup and let rest for
                    another 30â€“40 minutes until the rice absorbs the coconut mixture and becomes glossy.</p>
            </il>
            <il>
                <p>To serve, plate the coconut sticky rice with slices of ripe mango, drizzle with coconut sauce, and
                    sprinkle with crispy mung beans on top.</p>
